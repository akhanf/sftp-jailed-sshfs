Instructions for connecting to the SFTP server:

1. Get the IP (IPv4) address of the machine you will be connecting from, e.g. by navigating to the following webpage: http://www.icanhasyourip.com/

2. Reply to this e-mail with your IP address

3. Once the administrators have added your IP to the list (may take several hours after your e-mail), you will be able to connect.

4. You can use any GUI-based FTP client (e.g., Filezilla, Cyberduck, MobaXTerm, etc.).
